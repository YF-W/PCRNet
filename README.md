## Network Overview<br />
**Retinal vessels contain abundant pathological information, which is crucial for the early prevention and diagnosis of major systemic diseases. To address the issue of local vessel discontinuity caused by the patch-based image partitioning in Transformers, we proposed Stepwise Pixel Reconstruction, forming the Baseline based on this approach. The Baseline establishes spatial relationships between pixels, effectively solving the problem of frequent local vessel breakpoints and discontinuous segmentation. In addition, we designed two plug-and-play modules, DWD and MPIG, which specifically focus on segmenting vessels in mixed and blurred regions.**
